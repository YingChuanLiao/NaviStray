NaviStary is the name of motion planning algorithm which is developed by me. This algorithm is mixed version of A* and D*lite algorithm and it can find the shortest path given destinations. Also, it is able to detour to find the new optimal path if there is an obstacle which is on the original optimal path. The meaning behind the name of the algorithm is that it helps object navigate to their goals and never be stray.

The directory I uploaded includes html files, css files, and javascript files. The project is still in progress so so far it is not completed.
